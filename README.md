<h1 align="center">Make Notion Charts With Database Data</h1>

This is a basic custom code solution for integrating/viewing charts with Notion Database.
While going over this I have taken a lot of reference from the following article https://www.twilio.com/blog/make-notion-charts-with-database-data.

Note: As of now, Notion does not provide support for calling external API within notion databse. 

### Future Scope 
- Fully integrate the API with Notion Database.
